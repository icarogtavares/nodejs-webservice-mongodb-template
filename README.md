# nodejs-webservice-template
- Template of a webservice in NodeJS using **MongoDB** as database. This code is based on **node packages documentation**, **alura courses** and in
the book of [NodeJS by Waldemar Neto](https://github.com/waldemarnt/building-testable-apis-with-nodejs).

- An example code model for creating web services,
with several libraries used to increase **scalability**,
**performance**, **maintainability**, and **functionality**.

- All the bibliographic references for the respective sources
from where I took the content are in the file **package.json**.

- Some references have been omitted since there are dependencies in **package.json**.

### Using this template in production
If you want to use this template in production, I advise using [Winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) or [Bunyan](https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan) for logs instead of _console.log()_
